The firewall:
** Access Control, Packet Filtering, Network Address Translation (NAT) and Intrusion Prevention and Detection.
Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?
** Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, Authentication and Trust, Protection Against Interception and Manipulation and Compliance and Regulatory Requirements.
What monitoring is used for?
** They analyse the performance and operations of the servers, measure the overall health, and alert the administrators if the servers are not performing as expected

*Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue?
leave the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers unencrypted
*Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue?
If the server experiences hardware failure, software errors, or other issues that render it unavailable, write operations to the database will fail, leading to service disruptions and potential data loss
*Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem?
Servers with identical components may lack flexibility in adapting to different workload requirements or scaling needs, Managing a homogenous server environment can lead to increased complexity in configuration management, software updates, and troubleshooting.
